GROUP 6

a) Positives

	> The whole experience of meeting new people and developing something together had the sort of feel we beleive a company would offer.
	> Learnt a lot from our evaluator(Anubhav Chaturvedi) who helped us in improving the overall manner in which we were supposed to write and present the software.
	> The majority of the group pitched in with ideas in the design stage.
	> Learnt the importance of working as a group.
	> Handled submission deadlines positively and were focused on doing the best we could at all times.
	> Continuously pushed ourselves to improve and perfect whatever we had already built.
	
b) Negatives
	
	> Not everyone was well-versed with github.
	> The need to physically meet up to discuss and allot work and deal with issues was felt although there were provisions to do the same online.

c) What would we do differently the next time?
	
	> Try coding up the basic code structure in the initial few days.
	> Use GitHub and Specification docs more than we did this time around, to improve overall contribution from everyone.
