The UI is self-explanatory and the following inputs can be used to 
test the e-wallet system. 

Give the relevant inputs as prompted by the UI dialog boxes.

	Input Entries for Student = 	Name : Shreyash
				 	BITS ID : 1111
				 	Password : abcd
				 	PIN : 1234

	Input Entries for Vendor = 	Name : Borkar's Super Market
					username : bk123
					Password : abcd


These are the only relevant that entries any user(vendor/student) shall have to
make apart from the 'amount' entries that have to be made during an on-going transaction.
